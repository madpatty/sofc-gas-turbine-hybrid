# sofc-gas-turbine-hybrid

Hi People
I want to simulate a hybrid model of gas turbine and sofc(solid oxide fuel cells) to get the working system efficiency and other numbers.

But i am a total noob at programming and simulation.

I can provide the necessary data but don't exactly know what is needed at this point.
